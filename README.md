### What is Azure?

Azure, commonly referred to as Microsoft Azure, is a comprehensive cloud computing platform and service created by Microsoft. 

It provides a variety of cloud services, including those for computing, analytics, storage, and networking. 

Users can choose and configure these services to meet their specific needs. 

### Azure structure

- Azure offers a diverse array of over 200 services catering to various computing needs.
- All resources in Azure are organized within resource groups, ensuring efficient management and organization. 
- A resource group, can hold individual resources or a single item, though it is limited by the associated subscriptions. 
- Every creation within Azure, from virtual machines to databases, needs to be placed within a resource group. 
- These resource groups not only organize resources but also store essential metadata related to the resources contained within them. 
- Azure operates on a subscription-based model.
- Each subscription is associated with a specific payment method and scheme. 
- Different subscriptions can be grouped under management groups, offering a strategic way to manage access policies and compliance for multiple subscriptions. 
- Management groups enable the application of policies across various levels, providing a centralized approach to compliance and access management. 
- At each level, including subscriptions and management groups, policies and permissions can be applied. This flexibility is possible through scopes, allowing the definition of specific policies and permissions tailored to different levels within Azure's structure.
